Learning is a very important process. Sometimes, we may feel that we don't have enough time to learn things apart from our core job functions. Wouldn't summaries on summaries be nice?

I'm a computer engineer and I will make time to learn new things in both dev and non-dev areas. I plan on using this site to share the best of the dev things that I learn.

Each post will have my biggest takeaways. Basically, the information that I would have wanted to know to save myself from going through it all. Aka, high value information to words ratio.
