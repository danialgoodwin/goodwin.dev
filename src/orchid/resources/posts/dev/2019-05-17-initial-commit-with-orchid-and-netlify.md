For a long time now, I've been wanting to have my entire website's contents to be hosted in a git repository. My last setup, from a few years ago (danialgoodwin.com/blog) used Jekyll for the static site generation, but that didn't include a wiki, which I always love to have (and, I wanted a bit more).

Now that I have this nice .dev TLD, it's time for more experiments from scratch!

My first impressions of using Orchid + Netlify is that they are amazing, and sooo easy to setup. I'm up and running in 5 minutes, and didn't have any prior knowledge!

For the foreseeable future, I will continue this way. :)
